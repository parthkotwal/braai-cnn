# `braai-cnn`: Real/Bogus Transient Detection using CNNs and Classical ML

This is a deep learning project focused on distinguishing true astrophysical events from false detections in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) imaging data. The project reimplements the BRAAI CNN in both `PyTorch` and `CuPy` (GPU-accelerated `NumPy`) and evaluates them against classical machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
